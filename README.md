    The way I chose to approach this was simplicity. I wanted to keep things clean and minimal, yet smooth. Orange is my favorite color so I figured using a pastel version mixed with some opacity throughout the site would help accomplish that feeling.

    You can find the [deployed app here](https://www.google.com "Note Taker App").

<p>
    Challenges for this project included setting up my routes to post the existing notes on the front-end, as well as deleting notes. Once I dove into the material and did plenty of research, I figured out how to do both.
